The aim of this project is to create a web interface that shows filtered content based on the used login.

For example, you may want to show pictures of your dog to one group of people and photos of your last trip to another group.

This small Python script lets you add people to groups and define which group has access to each ressource.

For my needs, it was easier to hardcode user information into the script so the project isn't suited for large audiences.
